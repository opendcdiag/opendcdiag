# A Guide to Writing OpenDCDiag tests

This guide explains how to write tests for the OpenDCDiag framework.

## A first test

OpenDCDiag tests are written in C, C++, and occasionally in assembly language.
Simple tests consist of a single source file that contains a declarative
section, providing the framework with information about the test, and a
number of function calls that implement the test.

A [very simple test](../tests/examples/simple_add.c) is presented below

```c

#include "sandstone.h"

static unsigned int value1;
static unsigned int value2;
static unsigned int golden_sum;

static int simple_add_init(struct test *test)
{
        value1 = random32();
        value2 = random32();
        golden_sum = value1 + value2;

        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

static int simple_add_run(struct test *test, int cpu)
{
        unsigned int sum;

        TEST_LOOP(test, 1 << 20) {
                sum = value1 + value2;
                if (sum != golden_sum) {
                        report_fail_msg("Add failed.  Expected %u got %u",
                                        golden_sum, sum);
                }
        }
        
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

DECLARE_TEST(simple_add, "Repeatedly add two integer numbers")
        .test_init = simple_add_init,
        .test_run = simple_add_run,
        .quality_level = TEST_QUALITY_BETA,
END_DECLARE_TEST
```

The test begins with a comment containing the test name and a description of the
test. Each OpenDCDiag test is expected to contain such a comment providing some
information about what the test does and how it operates. The comment is
followed by some global variables\*, two static functions, and a declarative
section that registers the test with the OpenDCDiag framework.

:warning: \* Normally, it is not good practice to store test-specific data in global
  variables.  The reason for this and an alternative method for managing test
  data are presented later in the document.

### Declaring a new test

A new test is declared using the DECLARE_TEST macro. The first parameter is a test name.
Test names must be unique, are never changed once the test is merged, and should
also match the test name specified in the test description comment. The test name is
followed by a one-line description of the test. The DECLARE_TEST macro defines a new
instance of an OpenDCDiag *test* structure, which is documented in
[sandstone.h](../framework/sandstone.h). The *test* structure contains a number
of fields that tests can set to provide the OpenDCDiag framework with
information about the test. Our simple test sets three of these fields, each of
which will be explained below. For now, let's build and run our test.

### Building and running the test

To build the test, we need to add it to the OpenDCDiag build system. This can be
done by modifying the [tests/meson.build](../tests/meson.build) file in the tests
directory. Add the following lines to this file and rebuild.

```
tests_base_set.add(
        'examples/simple_add.c'
)
```

Now let's check to see if our test is available. A list of tests can be
obtained by passing the --list to the opendcdiag binary. Let's search for
our test by name.

```console
./opendcdiag --beta --list
```

You should see a list of test names and their descriptions. Somewhere in this
list there should be a line that looks something like this.

```
6 simple_add           "Repeatedly add two integer numbers"
```

To run the test, type

```
./opendcdiag --beta -v -e simple_add --output-format=tap
# opendcdiag --beta -v -e simple_add --output-format=tap
# Operating system: Linux 5.14.2-arch1-2
# Random generator state: LCG:560936296
ok   1 simple_add               # (beta test)
ok   2 simple_add               # (beta test)
ok   3 simple_add               # (beta test)
ok   4 simple_add               # (beta test)
ok   5 simple_add               # (beta test)
ok   6 simple_add               # (beta test)
ok   7 simple_add               # (beta test)
ok   8 mce_check
exit: pass
```

And you should see that the test has run and passed.

### Test quality

To execute our new test and see it in the list of tests, we needed to
pass the '--beta' command line option. The reason for this is that we added
the following to our test declaration

```c
        .quality_level = TEST_QUALITY_BETA,
```

By default, OpenDCDiag only runs production tests when executed, i.e., tests
with a *quality_level* of *TEST_QUALITY_PROD*. Why then did we label our new
test as a beta test?  This is an OpenDCDiag convention. New tests always
have their quality level set to *TEST_QUALITY_BETA*. After they have been merged
for a while and have executed without issue, their status is upgraded to
*TEST_QUALITY_PROD*.

### Fracturing

The test should have run and passed multiple times.
Each test is given a time slot in which it can run. By default, this time slot
is one second, but this default can be overridden in the test declaration using
the *desired_duration*, *minimum_duration*, and *maximum_duration* fields.  By
default, the OpenDCDiag framework continually runs a test until its
allocated time period has elapsed. Each test invocation is run in its own
process with a different random number seed. Assuming that the test uses random
numbers, as our simple test does, each invocation of the test performs
a different computation. This feature of OpenDCDiag is referred to as
fracturing and is the reason that you see the test being run multiple times.
Fracturing is enabled by default for all tests but it can be disabled on a test-
by-test basis by specifying a value of less than 0 for the *fracture_loop_count*
field when declaring a test. It may make sense to disable fracturing if you
only want your test to run once for some reason or if your init function (see
below) is very expensive.  It is also possible to disable fracturing from the
command line using the --max-test-loop-count option.  Specifying this option on
the opendcdiag command line and setting it to 0, e.g.,
--max-test-loop-count=0, disables fracturing for that run of opendcdiag.

### Test execution

When running a test, the OpenDCDiag performs the following steps (by default):

1. It creates a new process.
2. It calls the test's test_init function on the main thread of the new process.
The test_init function is optional and so is only invoked if provided. Our
simple_add test provides a small init function and we'll discuss its purpose
later.
3. It creates one software thread for each hardware thread in the system under
test that it can see and it pins each software thread to a hardware thread.
4. It invokes the test's test_run function in each thread, including the main
thread.
5. It waits for each of the test threads to finish executing and reports the
status of the test to the user.
6. It may then re-execute the test once more in a new process if time permits,
as we have seen.

To put this in the context of our simple_add test, the framework creates a new
process and calls our init_test function on the main thread of this process.
Our test function generates two random integers, computes the sum of those
integers and stores all three values in global variables. Our init function
returns EXIT_SUCCESS to indicate that all is well and that the test can proceed.
The framework then creates one thread for each hardware thread, pins software to
hardware thread, and then invokes the test_run function on each of these
threads. Our test_run function is simple; it sums the two random numbers
generated in the test_init function and then compares the result to the
pre-computed *golden_sum*. If there is a mismatch, an error is signaled to the
framework via the call to report_fail_msg. In addition to signaling and
logging an error, report_fail_msg causes the thread to exit. Our computation
and comparison are executed repeatedly in a loop, generated by the TEST_LOOP
macro. TEST_LOOP executes its body continuously until it is asked to terminate
by the OpenDCDiag framework. The second parameter to TEST_LOOP specifies the
granularity of our loop. In our simple_add test, we set the granularity to 1 <<
20. TEST_LOOP will perform 1 << 20 iterations and then ask the framework whether it's okay
to continue executing.  If there is some more time left in the test's time slot
TEST_LOOP performs another 1 << 20 iterations before checking with the
framework again. The process continues until the framework asks the test to
exit. If all instances of the test's test_run functions exit without error, the
test passes. By convention, the second parameter to TEST_LOOP is always a
power of two. The OpenDCDiag framework includes a facility to help test writers
select an appropriate value for the second parameter of TEST_LOOP. For more
information, see the [Test Tuning](#test-tuning) section below.

Our simple_add test is trivial and is unlikely to detect any real
problems. It does, however, illustrate the pattern used by most OpenDCDiag
tests. It computes a golden value in the *test_init* function, and then recomputes
that value in the test_run function that is executed on multiple hardware threads. The
values computed by the test_run functions are compared to the initial golden
value and, if there is a mismatch, an error is reported.


### Random numbers

Random numbers in simple_add are generated using a framework function called
random32 that returns a random number using the random number generator selected
for this invocation of OpenDCDiag. OpenDCDiag uses a number of different
random number generators and information about the generator used for any given
invocation is output when OpenDCDiag is run. Returning to the example output of our
OpenDCDiag invocation above, we see

```
# opendcdiag --beta -v -e simple_add --output-format=tap
# Operating system: Linux 5.14.2-arch1-2
# Random generator state: LCG:560936296
```

By default a different random number generator and seed is chosen each time
OpenDCDiag is run. However, this behavior can be overridden by specifying the
-s command line options. For example,

```
./opendcdiag --beta -v -s LCG:560936296 -e simple_add  --output-format=tap
```

results in a new invocation of simple_add that performs the exact same set
of computations as our original invocation. This is an important feature of the
OpenDCDiag framework as it allows failed tests that use random numbers to be
replayed using the same data. For this reason, it is important that tests use
the random number functions provided by the framework. The framework provides a
rich set of random number generating functions for a variety of types. These
are documented in [sandstone.h](../framework/sandstone.h). Examples include
*random64* for generating an unsigned random 64 bit numbers, *frandomf* for
generating a random float between 0.0 and 1.0, and *memset_random* for filling a
buffer with random data. The framework also overrides C standard library and OS
specific random functions such as *rand* and *random*, so that random numbers
generated by any 3rd party libraries used by the tests will also be generated
using the framework and hence reproducible.

## A second test

Now that we've covered the basics of creating an OpenDCDiag test, let's try something
a little bit more complex. Our new test is still going to test the system's
ability to add numbers, but rather than adding two numbers per thread on each
iteration of the test, we're going to add 1024 numbers, and we're going to do the
addition using SIMD instructions. Here's our [new test](../tests/examples/simple_add.c).

        .quality_level = TEST_QUALITY_BETA,
END_DECLARE_TEST
```

This new test makes more use of the OpenDCDiag framework than the first test
and we'll discuss each of the differences below. First, however, let's build
it. This can be done by adding the following lines to the
[meson.build](../tests/meson.build) file in the tests directory and rebuilding.

```
tests_base_skx_set.add(
        'examples/vector_add.c'
)
```

### Base architecture, mixed builds, and C++ global statics

Note this addition to the meson.build file is slightly different from the addition
we made for the first test; we use tests_base_skx_set.add instead of
tests_base_set.add.  This is required as our new test makes use of 
Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512)
intrinsics and will only build if our test source file is compiled with the
correct compiler options, in this case -march=skylake-avx512. This command line
option is not specified when compiling the files added to tests_base_set. It
follows then that not all the source files in an OpenDCDiag build are compiled
with the same compile options and this has some implications.

1. The framework and tests added to tests_base_set are compiled with
-march=haswell by default.  This default can be overridden via the march_base
meson option.
2. The OpenDCDiag binary is only guaranteed to run correctly on machines that
support the base architecture or greater. If run on older machines, it will
crash with SIGILL.
3. Test writers adding new tests that use features of the CPU not present in
the base architecture need to inform the framework that their test requires a
specific CPU feature. This is done using the DECLARE_TEST macro, which is shown
later. The framework checks the capabilities of the CPU on which it is
executed at runtime and skips any tests requiring features that the CPU
does not support.
4. Tests that are compiled with an -march greater than the base -march cannot
define global static variables that generate code. This is just an
issue for C++ tests that might define a global static instance of a class that
has a constructor. The compiler may generate code for the constructor that uses
instructions that are not present in the base architecture, and as this code is
run at program startup before the framework itself starts, the framework cannot
prevent it from executing. The end result could be that OpenDCDiag would fail
to start when run on a machine that just supported the base architecture. For this reason,
global statics are not allowed in OpenDCDiag tests. Note that some of the C++
standard library header files define global statics, e.g., \<iostream\>, so the
inclusion of such files in OpenDCDiag tests is not permitted.

### Running vector_add

We run our new test using the opendcdiag command as before specifying our new
test name

```
./opendcdiag --beta -v -e vector_add --output-format=tap
```

and the result should be something like this.

```
# opendcdiag --beta -v -e vector_add --output-format=tap
# Operating system: Linux 5.14.2-arch1-2
# Random generator state: LCG:112841597
ok   1 vector_add               # (beta test)
ok   2 vector_add               # (beta test)
ok   3 vector_add               # (beta test)
ok   4 mce_check
exit: pass
```

This output was generated on a machine that supports Intel AVX-512 and so our test ran
and passed.  When run on a machine that does not support Intel AVX-512 you should see
something like this.

```
# opendcdiag --beta -v -e vector_add --output-format=tap
# Operating system: Linux 5.14.2-arch1-2
# Random generator state: LCG:1332445696
ok   1 vector_add               # (beta test) SKIP
ok   2 mce_check
exit: pass
```

The OpenDCDiag framework knows that our test requires Intel AVX-512 and it also knows that the
machine it is being run on doesn't support this feature, so it skips the test.
If it ran the test, the test would crash.

### Minimum CPU

How does the OpenDCDiag framework know our test requires Intel AVX-512? It knows
because we advertised this fact the in the DECLARE_TEST macro.

```c
        .minimum_cpu = cpu_skylake_avx512,
```

minimum_cpu is a bit mask of features. The values are defined in cpu_features.h
file. This file is generated at build time and can be found in your meson build
folder.

### Memory allocation and cleanup

Our new test, vector_add allocates memory dynamically in both its *test_init*
and *test_run* functions. Memory is allocated using three different functions;
*malloc*, *aligned_alloc*, and *aligned_alloc_safe*.  *malloc* and
*aligned_alloc* should be familiar to the reader as they are part of the C
standard library and [POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2018edition/)
respectively. The third function, *aligned_alloc_safe*
is a framework function that calls *aligned_alloc* but before it does so, it
ensures that the size of the memory being allocated is a multiple of the
requested alignment, a requirement of *aligned_alloc*. If it is not, the size
of the requested memory is increased so that the constraints of *aligned_alloc*
are met. Note that the test does not check the return value of any of the
memory allocation functions. The reason for this is that the OpenDCDiag
framework actually overrides the standard C library and Posix memory allocation
functions, so that any allocation failure results in the calling thread
exiting. The overridden functions also fill the allocated memory with zeros
before returning, so there is no need to memset dynamically allocated buffers to
zero in OpenDCDiag tests.

The *test_init* function allocates three buffers. These buffers are 64-byte
aligned as required by the *prv_do_add* function that actually performs the
addition. The first two buffers are filled with random data using the framework
function *memset_random* and the third buffer is initialized by calling
*prv_do_add*. Pointers to all three buffers are stored in a dynamically
allocated structure and a pointer to this structure is stored in the *data*
field of the test object. Data needed by a test for a single invocation can be
allocated dynamically, as in this example, and stored in the *test->data* field where
it can be retrieved in the *test_run* or *test_cleanup* functions.

**Use of the *test->data* field is the recommended way of managing test-specific
data whose lifetime matches that of the test, i.e., data that needs to be
available in both the *test_init* and *test_run* functions. It provides a
better alternative to using global statics as was done in the first example.
Global statics can cause problems with tests written in C++ as we have seen. In
addition, as all the OpenDCDiag tests are built into one executable, the costs of
global static data introduced by one test are borne by all tests and the main
OpenDCDiag process itself, even if the test that created the global static data
is never actually run.**

The dynamically-allocated data is freed in the *test_cleanup* function. This
function is run in the test's process on the main thread once the test has
finished. It is run if the test passed and it is run if it failed cleanly
(i.e., didn't crash or hang). In most cases, it is not actually necessary to
free memory in *test_cleanup* that was dynamically allocated in the init
function when a test completes. The reason is that each invocation of a test is
run in a separate process that exits directly after *test_cleanup* is run.
Any memory not freed by the test is reclaimed by the OS once the test completes.
Thus, it's not really possible for a test to leak memory in a way that affectn
the main OpenDCDiag process or any of the other tests it runs. There is
one exception though, test slicing, which is discussed below.

### memcmp_or_fail

Our new test performs the same vectorized additions on the same data on each
thread. To determine if the test has passed, we need to compare the
results computed in the *test_run* function to the golden result computed in the
*test_init* function. The OpenDCDiag framework provides a convenience function
for performing this comparison; memcmp_or_fail. memcmp_or_fail accepts at
least three parameters in the following order; the newly computed data, the
expected data, and the number of elements to compare. The interesting thing
about memcmp_or_fail is that it is type aware even when called from C code. So
the third parameter needs to be set to the number of elements and not the number
of bytes. In our new test, we pass it two arrays of 32-bit unsigned integers and
pass the number of integers in those arrays as the third argument. memcmp_or_fail
then compares the elements in the actual and expected arrays and fails
the test with some detailed log information if there is an error. If
memcmp_or_fail detects an error, it stops the normal execution of the
current thread. The attentive reader may notice that if this were to happen, we
would actually leak the *res* buffer, but as the test has failed, its process
is terminated and the memory is reclaimed by the OS. This sort of
memory leak is acceptable in OpenDCDiag code.


If your test contains multiple calls to *memcmp_or_fail* that compare the same
types of data, it can be difficult to determine which call actually failed by
looking at the logs. In such cases, the test writer is expected to
provide one or more additional parameters to describe the data. The first is a
printf like format string and any subsequent parameters provide the data for
that format string. Here's an example from the zstd test.

```c
    memcmp_or_fail(back_buf, buf, bufsz, "decompressed data");
```

### Logging

By default, OpenDCDiag creates a log file and writes to that log file as it
executes the tests. Information about the results of the tests plus any
additional information the tests log is output to the log file. If the
entire test run succeeds without error, OpenDCDiag deletes the log file.  If
you'd like to preserve the logfile you can use the -o parameter to provide an
explicit log file name. OpenDCDiag will not remove log files specified with the
-o parameter, even when there is no error. It is also possible to get
OpenDCDiag to log to standard output with '-o -'.  This is useful when debugging.

At this stage, it's instructive to look at what an OpenDCDiag test looks like
when it fails.  Let's modify our *test_run* function to induce a failure by
adding the following two lines

```c
         TEST_LOOP(test, 1 << 13) {
                 memset(res, 0, VECTOR_ADD_BUF_SIZE);
                 prv_do_add(va->a, va->b, res);
+                if (cpu == 0)
+                        res[10] = 0xffffffff;
```

These two lines corrupt the computed result in the first test thread. This
causes the call to memcmp_or_fail to fail and log an error. If you re-build
and re-run openDCDiag, e.g., by typing

```
./opendcdiag --beta -e vector_add -o -
```

you should see something like this on your screen.

```

```

You should also see that the test has been re-run by the framework and that it
consistently fails. When a test fails, OpenDCDiag re-runs the test in an
attempt to discover whether the failure is specific to a core or a hardware
thread. In this case, it is because we've deliberately induced a failure on the
first hardware thread discovered by OpenDCDiag.

In addition to memcmp_or_fail, the OpenDCDiag has some additional logging
functions that can be used. Among these functions are *log_debug*, *log_info*,
*log_warning* and *log_error*. They all behave like printf and are declared in
[sandstone.h](../framework/sandstone.h). OpenDCDiag also provides an additional
function that is useful for logging binary data, *log_data*, also declared and
documented in [sandstone.h](../framework/sandstone.h).

There is one golden rule of logging in OpenDCDiag tests. Tests are only allowed
to log information on their error paths.  A test that completes successfully
should not write any additional information to the logs. It is appropriate to
use the log functions to log information on the non-error paths during a test's
development but these statements must be removed before the test is merged. The
one exception here are *log_debug* statements. These statements can be included
in the non-error paths of production tests, but they only generate output on
debug builds (they are compiled out of release builds).

By default, OpenDCDiag limits the amount of log statements that each test
invocation can make. By default this value is set to five.  If a test has already
issued five log statements, its sixth and subsequent log statements will be ignored
and will not appear in the logs. The framework also limits the amount of data
that can be logged with the *log_data* function, by default, to 128 bytes.  If
then, your logs are truncated, specify the --max-messages and
--max-logdata parameters when executing opendcdiag. Both these options take an
integer parameter. Setting this parameter to zero removes all limits.

One final note about logging. Any data written to standard output is
discarded. Adding a printf statement to a test has no effect. If you
want to see debug output in your logs, use the logging functions provided.
Information written to standard error will appear in the logs.  However,
test writers are expected to use the framework's logging functions rather than
writing to standard error directly.

## Additional information

### Test groups

OpenDCDiag allows test writers to assign their tests to one or
more groups. Tests in the same group share some characteristics. For
example, they may all focus on one part of a CPU's architecture or
they may all employ the same sort of testing techniques. The nice
thing about assigning a test to a group is that you can easily run or
exclude all the tests in a group using simple command line options.
OpenDCDiag currently defines a number of groups. These can be seen by
running the following command.

```
./opendcdiag --list-groups
@compression
@math
```

To view the tests that form part of each group, run the opendcdiag
command with the --list option. This lists all the tests and outputs
some information about the defined test groups.  Example
group information output by this option is presented below.

```
Groups:
@compression           "Tests that drive compression routines in various libraries"
  zstd_aaa
  zstd1
  zstd
  zstd19
  zfuzz
  zlib_aaa
  zlib1
  zlib
@math                  "Tests that perform math using, e.g., Eigen"
  eigen_gemm_double14
  eigen_gemm_cdouble_dynamic_square
  eigen_gemm_double_dynamic_square
  eigen_gemm_float_dynamic_square
  eigen_svd_cdouble_noavx512
  eigen_sparse
  eigen_svd
  eigen_svd_double
  eigen_svd_double2
  eigen_svd_fvectors
  eigen_svd_cdouble
```

It's possible to run all the tests in a specific group with a simple
command line invocation. This invocation uses the -e option which we
have already seen, but rather than specifying a test name, we specify a
group name. For example we can run all the compression tests as follows:

```
./opendcdiag -v -e @compression --output-format=tap
# opendcdiag -v -e @compression --output-format=tap
# Operating system: Linux 5.14.2-arch1-2
# Random generator state: LCG:345873330
ok   1 zstd_aaa
ok   2 zstd1
ok   3 zstd1
ok   4 zstd
ok   5 zstd19
ok   6 zstd19
ok   7 zfuzz
ok   8 zlib_aaa
ok   9 zlib1
ok  10 zlib1
ok  11 zlib
ok  12 zlib
ok  13 zlib
ok  14 mce_check
exit: pass
```

We can run all the tests except for the compression tests by using
--disable @compression.

Adding a test to an existing group is easy. We need to fill in
the *groups* field of the *test* structure using the
*DECLARE_TEST_GROUPS* macro. For example, let's suppose we wanted to
add our first test to the math group. We would add the
following line to our test declaration

```c
 DECLARE_TEST(simple_add, "Repeatedly add two integer numbers")
+        .groups = DECLARE_TEST_GROUPS(&group_math),
```

If we rebuild and run OpenDCDiag once more with the --beta and --list
option, we should see that simple_add has been added to the math
group.

Tests can be members of multiple groups. The DECLARE_TEST_GROUPS
macro accepts a comma-separated list of group pointers. The groups
themselves are defined in
[sandstone_test_groups_p.h](../framework/sandstone_test_groups_p.h).
To add a new group, modify this file.

### Skipping tests

We've seen that the OpenDCDiag framework can automatically skip tests that make
use of instructions that are not supported on the test machine. To take
advantage of this facility, test writers need to fill in the *minimum_cpu*
field.  There may, however, be other reasons that a test cannot be run on a
given machine. For example, the test may make use of an OS feature that is not
present on all platforms or it may require root or administrator access to run.
The framework doesn't provide any support for detecting
these conditions so it is up to individual tests to 'self skip' if they detect
conditions that will prevent them from running. This is done by performing a
test in the *test_init* function and returning *EXIT_SKIP* if the test fails.
For example, suppose we write a test that will work fine on Linux\* but will not run
on Windows\*.  In this case we might write an *test_init* function that looks like
this:

```c
static int linux_only_init(struct test *test)
{
#ifdef _WIN32
        log_info("The linux_only test is not supported on Windows");
        return EXIT_SKIP;
#endif
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Note that returning any negative value from the *test_init* function causes
the test to skip.  If the reason for the skip was due to the failure of a C
standard library function or system call, it can be useful to make the test skip
by returning *-errno*, rather than *EXIT_SKIP*.

All tests are expected to build and run on Linux and Windows.  OS-specific
tests are expected to perform a test similar to what is shown above in
their *test_init* functions. Tests that cannot be run on the host machine
should skip and exit cleanly. They should not fail and they should not crash.
A log statement may be issued to explain the reason for skipping the test.

### Test tuning

It is not always obvious what value to pass for the second parameter
to TEST_LOOP. The value needs to be small enough so that the
framework can fracture the test a number of times and large enough to
ensure that the costs of setting up and tearing down the test, e.g.,
process creation, the execution of test_init, etc., are a very small
proportion of the runtime of the overall test. Ideally, we want our
test to spend as much of its allocated time slot as possible in its
test_run function, while accepting that we probably need to fracture it
to improve its effectiveness.

The framework includes a command line option, --test-tests, to help
select an appropriate value for the second parameter of TEST_LOOP.
This option is only available in debug builds and should only be used
in optimized debug builds. To create an optimized debug build pass
the -Dbuildtype=debugoptimized option to the meson command, e.g.:

```
meson builddir -Dbuildtype=debugoptimized
```

Next, let's re-run our first test with this option enabled.

```
./opendcdiag --beta -v -e simple_add --output-format=tap --test-tests
# opendcdiag --beta -v -e simple_add --output-format=tap --test-tests
# Operating system: Linux 5.14.2-arch1-2
# Random generator state: AES:0a79e69180729ce1a9069ee561104850f586196e7f8d631e56f9611a9eefb7af
ok   1 simple_add               # (beta test)
ok   2 mce_check
exit: pass
```

With a bit of luck, our test should still pass. Now, for
the sake of demonstration, let's modify the second parameter to
TEST_LOOP from 1<<20 to 1<<10, rebuild our test, and re-run it with the
--test-tests option. The test should now fail with an error message.

```
tests:
- test: simple_add
  result: fail
  fail: { cpu-mask: null, time-to-fail: null, seed: 'LCG:704221692'}
  time-at-end:   { elapsed:   1000.037, now: !!timestamp '2021-09-29T11:08:54Z' }
  test-runtime: 1001.553
  threads:
  - thread: main
    messages:
    - { level: error, text: 'E> Inner loop is too short (average 0.001 ms) -- suggest making the test 5431x longer' }
# Test failed 1 out of 1 times (100.0%)
```

We sped up our test loop by 1024 times and the OpenDCDiag framework is
informing us that it is now too fast. When run without the
--test-tests option, the test will still pass. Interestingly, the
framework is recommending that our sped-up test loop be slowed down by
5431x and not 1024x. The reason for this is that the initial value
for *simple_add* was manually chosen, i.e., not chosen by using
--test-tests, and that the chosen value was too small. Our original
test still passes when run with --test-tests, as --test-tests has a
high degree of tolerance. Nevertheless, the recommendation is for
test developers to use --test-tests to tune their tests once the tests
are functionally complete. Doing so improves the effectiveness of
their tests. Note the use of --test-tests for test tuning is not
needed for tests that disable fracturing.


### CPU info

Sometimes tests need access to information about the cores, threads and packages
on which they run. The OpenDCDiag makes this information available via its
API.

#### num_cpus

It provides a function called *num_cpus* which returns the number of
hardware threads the current invocation of the test will be run on. Normally,
this is equal to the number of hardware threads in the machine under test, but
this is not always the case; if for example, the test uses slicing (see below),
the user specified the --cpuset parameter when executing opendcdiag, or the OS
restricts the number of threads that are visible to OpenDCDiag in some way. The
*num_cpus* function can be called in the *test_init*, *test_run* and
*test_cleanup* functions.

#### cpu_info and cpu

The *test_run* function's second parameter, *cpu*, has not been been discussed
in much detail until now. This parameter is an OpenDCDiag specific identifier
that identifies the hardware thread on which the current instance of the
*test_run* function is executing. It will always be greater than or equal to zero
and less than the value returned by *num_cpus*. It can be used as an index into
a global array maintained by the framework called *cpu_info*. This is an array
of structures, also called *cpu_info* that contain information about the
hardware threads on which the test is being run. The *cpu_info* structure is
documented in [sandstone.h](../framework/sandstone.h). It can be used for
example to figure out which core the current thread is associated with, how much
cache that core has, in which socket the current core is located, and what
version microcode the thread is running.

### Slicing

By default, when running a test, OpenDCDiag creates a new process, calls the
*test_init* function on the main thread of that process, creates a new software
thread for each hardware thread visible to it and then executes the *test_run*
function on each of these threads. This model of execution does not suit all
tests. One example of such a test is one that allocates a lot of memory in its
*test_run* function. Such tests may run fine on a single socket machine with 8
threads but may struggle on multi-socket machines with say 96 threads as all
of the allocations happen in parallel. If each *test_run* thread allocates 1GB
of memory the test would allocate 96GB on our hypothetical machine when
running. The framework provides support for tests like this that cannot run
their *test_run* function on all hardware threads at the same time via a feature
call slicing.  Slicing is enabled by specifying the *max_threads* field when
declaring the test using the DECLARE_TEST macro. It specifies the maximum
number of parallel invocations of the test's *test_run* function. For example,
if max_threads is set to 4, the framework will ensure that the *test_run*
function will not run on any more than four threads at any one time.  When the
*max_threads* field is specified the model of test execution is altered.   The
framework runs the test as follows.

1. It creates a new process.
2. It identifies a set of hardware threads on which the *test_run* function has
not yet been run. The size of this set will be no greater than *max_threads*,
although it may be smaller.
3. It calls the init function on the main thread. The framework ensures that
the return value of the framework's *num_cpu* function will return a value of no
greater than *max_threads* and that the *cpu_info* structure contains the
correct information for the current set of hardware threads.
4. It then runs the *test_run* function on each of these threads.
5. The *test_cleanup* function is called.
6. If there are still some hardware threads on which the *test_run* functions
have not yet been executed, we go back to step 2.
7. Otherwise the test completes.

The interesting thing to note is that, when slicing is used, a test's
*test_init* function may be called multiple times in the same process and the
test needs to be able to cope with this. For example, the advice given above
about not needing to free dynamically allocated memory in the *test_cleanup*
function does not apply when slicing is employed. Doing so may lead to a memory
leak that could impact the running of the test. Note this behavior is
different from fracturing. A test's *test_init* function can be called multiple
times when a test is fractured, but each invocation takes place in a separate
process.

### Debugging tests

Each OpenDCDiag test is run in its own separate process as we have seen. This
can make debugging of tests with a debugger a little tricky. For this
reason, OpenDCDiag contains a development option, --fork-mode. Setting the
value of this option to "no" forces OpenDCDiag to run tests in its own process.

Another aspect of the way the OpenDCDiag frameworks works that can complicate
debugging is the way that it runs the *test_run* function multiple times in
parallel on different threads. If you need to debug and step through the
*test_run* function, it's probably easiest to limit OpenDCDiag to a single thread.
This can be achieved using the -n option. Thus a typical command line for
debugging a test might be.

```console
gdb --args ./opendcdiag --beta -e vector_add --fork-mode=no -n1
```

The framework also provides support for debugging hung tests. By default the
framework will kill tests that have not responded after 5 minutes. You'll
probably see something like this in your logs when a test hangs

```
# opendcdiag --beta -v -e simple_add --output-format=tap
# Operating system: Linux 5.8.0-63-generic
# Random generator state: LCG:1315282236
not ok   1 simple_add           # (beta test) timed out
 ---
  info: {version: f09c9ae329da-dirty, timestamp: 2021-09-24T12:52:16Z, virtualized: true}
  fail: { cpu-mask: 'X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X', time-to-fail: null, seed: 'LCG:1315282236'}
  Main thread:
   - 'E> Child 18834 did not exit, sending signal SIGQUIT'
  Thread 0 on CPU 0 (pkg 0, core 0, thr 0, family/model/stepping 06-55-04, microcode 0x1, PPIN N/A):
   - 'E> Thread is stuck'
```

The default behavior can be overridden via the --on-hang development option.
The option --on-hang=gdb can be used automatically launch gdb to debug the hung
test. This option may require administrator privileges to work.
