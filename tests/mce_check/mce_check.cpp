 * This test just checks the number of Machine Check Events that the
 * system has reported and compares it agains the number reported at
 * the beginning of the sandstone run.  If there is a difference then
 * it reports an error.
 *
 * The purpose of this is to report that a new machine check event was
 * listed in the logs during the execution of all the tests.
 *
 * This "test" is not really a test in the same way that it does not
 * cause or look for any errors it creates.  If it fails, it means that
 * one of the previous tests executed by this execution of sandstone
 * likely caused a Machine Check Abort (MCA)
 *
 * Checking is done by ensuring the code always leaves by the expected
 * path.  If this test fails it is likely going to be a seg-fault or
 * UD fault due to a miscalculated jump target.
